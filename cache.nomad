      # The "vault" stanza instructs the Nomad client to acquire a token from
      # a HashiCorp Vault server. The Nomad servers must be configured and
      # authorized to communicate with Vault. By default, Nomad will inject
      # The token into the job via an environment variable and make the token
      # available to the "template" stanza. The Nomad client handles the renewal
      # and revocation of the Vault token.
